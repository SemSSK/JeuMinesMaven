## Priority Decision

1. Solving the redundant declaration of Random. ✅
2. Moving Attributes declaration from the newGame Method to the default constructor. ✅
3. Reducing the complexity of the newGame method. ✅
4. Solving the click restart problem. ✅
5. Reducing the complexity of the find_empty method. ✅
6. Tackling the Code smells found by static analysis tools following the order of priority definded by it (from the most critical (Complexity,Bugs ...) the the least critical(Naming conventions ...)). ✅
7. Reducing the coupling between the Logic and the UI.
8. Reanalyse and refactor if necessary.
